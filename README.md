# SatMod2Mod

We explore using deep learning to learn mappings from one satellite imaging modality to another.

* Some modalitities are expensive to obtain, or not available at the needed time.
* Some modalitities are more intrerpretable to the untrained eye
* Some algorithms require having specific bands, or they are trained on specific bands and we would like to achieve a similar performance on new bands
